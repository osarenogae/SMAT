Safety Modelling for Assurance Toolkit (SMAT)
Motivation: 
It is the foremost desire of every licensed health practitioner to "do no harm". This means the actions of the healthcare provider would not directly or indirectly cause harm to the patient, assuring the safety of the process
and the outcome. However, the World Health Organisation notes that one in every 10 patients is harmed in health care and more than three million deaths occur annually worldwide due to unsafe care.

More to this, there is a rapid increase in the adoption of digital technology in the healthcare industry. While this enables faster, more accurate, and more successful outcomes, it does raise a concern over the safety
of the care processes with technology being another key component to be considered. Healthcare professionals, and more especially patients, need to be assured that the process of receiving care is in line with 
the Hippocratic Oath â€“ to do no harm. Local adaptations of care processes, utilizing well-known digital products, may result in unexpected results. There is also the fact that not all custom software developed treat
safety as a critical attribute during development. Hence, there is need for a tool to assure patient safety when digital technology is involved.

Description:
The SMAT looks to meet this need. It aims to provide a framework for patient safety analysis. The toolkit allows for the modelling of medical procedures and care processes such that pathways that deviate from a threshold
of safety and could result in a hazard are identified. The models are developed by collecting data on a care process and feeding it to a machine learning algorithm, Using Generative AI, the models are able to infer
potential hazards that could result in certain pathways. The solution is being developed in two phases: first the software and then the mobile application.
